# Font Files for Certificate Generation

To get better text quality on certificates, download DejaVu Serif font:

1. Download DejaVuSerif-Bold.ttf from https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/
2. Place it in this directory as `DejaVuSerif-Bold.ttf`
3. The system will automatically use TTF font for better quality

DejaVu Serif provides elegant, professional appearance for certificate names.
If no TTF font is available, the system will use built-in fonts with enhanced rendering.
